What's new in ver 2.0.0:

Currently targeting .NET 6 / 7 and the corresponding .NET MAUI release.

A parameter named framework has been introduced that takes either net6.0 or net7.0 as its options (with net7.0 being the default value).

dotnet new winforms-blazor --framework net6.0

dotnet new winforms-blazor -f net7.0

Unified template now also available as a VS extension.
